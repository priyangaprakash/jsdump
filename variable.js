                    //***********************VARIABLES**********************
//variables are declared:
/* with "var" keyword
   without "var" keyword will consider that value as global but it is not recommended as
   it may overrite any existing global variable
*/

var one = 1;
var text = "string";
var bbool = true;

//we can also write
var one = 1,text = "string",bbool = true;

//variable without declaration will take the value as "UNDEFINED"
 var notDefined; //will take value as "undefined"
 
 //javascript is loosely typed language because it doesnot requires the datatype to be given while declaring the
 //variable whereas c# and java are strongly typed language
